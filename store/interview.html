        <button class="accordion">Explain event delegation</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            Event delegation is a technique involving adding event listeners to a parent element instead of adding them to the descendant elements. The listener will fire whenever the event is triggered on the descendant elements due to event bubbling up the DOM.<br> The benefits of this technique are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Memory footprint goes down because only one single handler is needed on the parent element, rather than having to attach event handlers on each descendant.</li>
            <li>There is no need to unbind the handler from elements that are removed and to bind the event for new elements.</li>
            
          </ul>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Describe event bubbling.</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            When an event triggers on a DOM element, it will attempt to handle the event if there is a listener attached, then the event is bubbled up to its parent and the same thing happens. This bubbling occurs up the element's ancestors all the way to the document. Event bubbling is the mechanism behind event delegation.
          </p>

        <button class="accordion">Explain how this works in JavaScript</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>There's no simple explanation for this; it is one of the most confusing concepts in JavaScript.
          I think there are 6 rules are applied:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>If the new keyword is used when calling the function, this inside the function is a brand new object.</li>
            <li>If apply, call, or bind are used to call/create a function, this inside the function is the object that is passed in as the argument.</li>
            <li>If a function is called as a method, such as obj.method() — this is the object that the function is a property of.</li>
            <li>If a function is invoked as a free function invocation, meaning it was invoked without any of the conditions present above, this is the global object. In a browser, it is the window object. If in strict mode ('use strict'), this will be undefined instead of the global object.</li>
            <li>If multiple of the above rules apply, the rule that is higher wins and will set the this value.</li>
            <li>If the function is an ES2015 arrow function, it ignores all the rules above and receives the this value of its surrounding scope at the time it is created.</li>
          
          </ul>
        </div>


        <button class="accordion">Explain how prototypal inheritance works</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            This is an extremely common JavaScript interview question. All JavaScript objects have a prototype property, that is a reference to another object. When a property is accessed on an object and if the property is not found on that object, the JavaScript engine looks at the object's prototype, and the prototype's prototype and so on, until it finds the property defined on one of the prototypes or until it reaches the end of the prototype chain.
          </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Explain why the following doesn't work as an IIFE: function foo(){ }();. What needs to be changed to properly make it an IIFE?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            IIFE stands for Immediately Invoked Function Expressions. The JavaScript parser reads function foo(){ }(); as function foo(){ } and ();, where the former is a function declaration and the latter (a pair of brackets) is an attempt at calling a function but there is no name specified, hence it throws Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ).<br>

            Here are two ways to fix it that involves adding more brackets: (function foo(){ })() and (function foo(){ }()). Statements that begin with function are considered to be function declarations; by wrapping this function within (), it becomes a function expression which can then be executed with the subsequent (). These functions are not exposed in the global scope and you can even omit its name if you do not need to reference itself within the body.
          </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">What's the difference between a variable that is: null, undefined or undeclared? How would you go about checking for any of these states?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            <strong>Undeclared</strong> variables are created when you assign a value to an identifier that is not previously created using var, let or const. Undeclared variables will be defined globally, outside of the current scope. In strict mode, a ReferenceError will be thrown when you try to assign to an undeclared variable. Undeclared variables are bad just like how global variables are bad. Avoid them at all cost! To check for them, wrap its usage in a try/catch block.
          </p>
          <p>
            A variable that is <b>undefined</b> is a variable that has been declared, but not assigned a value. It is of type undefined. If a function does not return any value as the result of executing it is assigned to a variable, the variable also has the value of undefined. To check for it, compare using the strict equality (===) operator or typeof which will give the 'undefined' string. Note that you should not be using the abstract equality operator to check, as it will also return true if the value is null.
          </p>
          <p>
            A variable that is <strong>null</strong> will have been explicitly assigned to the null value. It represents no value and is different from undefined in the sense that it has been explicitly assigned. To check for null, simply compare using the strict equality operator. Note that like the above, you should not be using the abstract equality operator (==) to check, as it will also return true if the value is undefined.
          </p>
          <p>As a personal habit, I never leave my variables undeclared or unassigned. I will explicitly assign null to them after declaring if I don't intend to use it yet. If you use a linter in your workflow, it will usually also be able to check that you are not referencing undeclared variables.
          </p>
        </div>


        <button class="accordion">What is a closure, and how/why would you use one?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared. The word "lexical" refers to the fact that lexical scoping uses the location where a variable is declared within the source code to determine where that variable is available. Closures are functions that have access to the outer (enclosing) function's variables—scope chain even after the outer function has returned.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Data privacy / emulating private methods with closures. Commonly used in the module pattern.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Explain Ajax in as much detail as possible.</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            Ajax (asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a set of web development techniques using many web technologies on the client side to create asynchronous web applications. With Ajax, web applications can send data to and retrieve from a server asynchronously (in the background) without interfering with the display and behavior of the existing page. By decoupling the data interchange layer from the presentation layer, Ajax allows for web pages, and by extension web applications, to change content dynamically without the need to reload the entire page. In practice, modern implementations commonly substitute use JSON instead of XML, due to the advantages of JSON being native to JavaScript.
          </p>
        </div>


        <button class="accordion">What are the advantages and disadvantages of using Ajax?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <h4>Advantages</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Better interactivity. New content from the server can be changed dynamically without the need to reload the entire page.</li>
            <li>Reduce connections to the server since scripts and stylesheets only have to be requested once.</li>
            <li>State can be maintained on a page. JavaScript variables and DOM state will persist because the main container page was not reloaded.</li>
            <li>Basically most of the advantages of an SPA.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Dynamic webpages are harder to bookmark.</li>
            <li>Does not work if JavaScript has been disabled in the browser.</li>
            <li>Some webcrawlers do not execute JavaScript and would not see content that has been loaded by JavaScript.</li>
            <li>Basically most of the disadvantages of an SPA.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>


        <button class="accordion">Explain how JSONP works (and how it's not really Ajax).</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            JSONP (JSON with Padding) is a method commonly used to bypass the cross-domain policies in web browsers because Ajax requests from the current page to a cross-origin domain is not allowed.<br>
            JSONP works by making a request to a cross-origin domain via a &lt;script&gt; tag and usually with a callback query parameter, for example: https://example.com?callback=printData. The server will then wrap the data within a function called printData and return it to the client.
          </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Explain "hoisting".</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            Hoisting is a term used to explain the behavior of variable declarations in your code. Variables declared or initialized with the var keyword will have their declaration "moved" up to the top of the current scope, which we refer to as hoisting. However, only the declaration is hoisted, the assignment (if there is one), will stay where it is.
          </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">What is the difference between == and ===?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            == is the abstract equality operator while === is the strict equality operator. The == operator will compare for equality after doing any necessary type conversions. The === operator will not do type conversion, so if two values are not the same type === will simply return false. 
          </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">What is "use strict";? What are the advantages and disadvantages to using it?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            'use strict' is a statement used to enable strict mode to entire scripts or individual functions. Strict mode is a way to opt into a restricted variant of JavaScript. 
          </p>
          <h4><strong>Advantages:</strong></h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Makes it impossible to accidentally create global variables.</li>
            <li>Makes assignments which would otherwise silently fail to throw an exception.</li>
            <li>Makes attempts to delete undeletable properties throw (where before the attempt would simply have no effect).</li>
            <li>Requires that function parameter names be unique.</li>
            <li>this is undefined in the global context.</li>
            <li>It catches some common coding bloopers, throwing exceptions.</li>
            <li>It disables features that are confusing or poorly thought out.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Many missing features that some developers might be used to.</li>
            <li>No more access to function.caller and function.arguments.</li>
            <li>Concatenation of scripts written in different strict modes might cause issues.</li> 
          </ul>

        </div>

        <button class="accordion">What's a typical use case for anonymous functions?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            1. They can be used in IIFEs to encapsulate some code within a local scope so that variables declared in it do not leak to the global scope.

            <pre class="codeedit" style="padding-bottom: 0px" ><code class="language-js">
(function() {
  // Some code here.
})();
            </code></pre>
          </p>

          <p>
            2. As a callback that is used once and does not need to be used anywhere else. The code will seem more self-contained and readable when handlers are defined right inside the code calling them, rather than having to search elsewhere to find the function body.
            <pre class="codeedit" style="padding-bottom: 0px" ><code class="language-js">
setTimeout(function() {
  console.log('Hello world!');
}, 1000);
            </code></pre>
          </p>

          <p>
            3. Arguments to functional programming constructs or Lodash (similar to callbacks).
            <pre class="codeedit" style="padding-bottom: 0px" ><code class="language-js">
const arr = [1, 2, 3];
const double = arr.map(function(el) {
  return el * 2;
});
console.log(double); // [2, 4, 6]
            </code></pre>
          </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">What's the difference between .call and .apply?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            Both .call and .apply are used to invoke functions and the first parameter will be used as the value of this within the function. However, .call takes in comma-separated arguments as the next arguments while .apply takes in an array of arguments as the next argument. An easy way to remember this is C for call and comma-separated and A for apply and an array of arguments. 
          </p>
          <pre class="codeedit" style="padding-bottom: 0px" ><code class="language-js">
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

console.log(add.call(null, 1, 2)); // 3
console.log(add.apply(null, [1, 2])); // 3
            </code></pre>

        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Explain Function.prototype.bind</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            The bind() method creates a new function that, when called, has its this keyword set to the provided value, with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called. 
          </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Why is extending built-in JavaScript objects not a good idea?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            Extending a built-in/native JavaScript object means adding properties/functions to its prototype. While this may seem like a good idea at first, it is dangerous in practice. Imagine your code uses a few libraries that both extend the Array.prototype by adding the same contains method, the implementations will overwrite each other and your code will break if the behavior of these two methods is not the same.
          </p>

          <p>

            The only time you may want to extend a native object is when you want to create a polyfill, essentially providing your own implementation for a method that is part of the JavaScript specification but might not exist in the user's browser due to it being an older browser.
            
          </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Explain Function.prototype.bind</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            The bind() method creates a new function that, when called, has its this keyword set to the provided value, with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called. 
          </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Explain the difference between synchronous and asynchronous functions.</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            Synchronous functions are blocking while asynchronous functions are not. In synchronous functions, statements complete before the next statement is run. In this case, the program is evaluated exactly in order of the statements and execution of the program is paused if one of the statements take a very long time.
          </p>

          <p>
            Asynchronous functions usually accept a callback as a parameter and execution continue on the next line immediately after the asynchronous function is invoked. The callback is only invoked when the asynchronous operation is complete and the call stack is empty. Heavy duty operations such as loading data from a web server or querying a database should be done asynchronously so that the main thread can continue executing other operations instead of blocking until that long operation to complete (in the case of browsers, the UI will freeze).
          </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Explain the differences on the usage of foo between Function Declaration foo() {} and Function Expression var foo = function() {}</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            The former is a function declaration while the latter is a function expression. The key difference is that function declarations have its body hoisted but the bodies of function expressions are not (they have the same hoisting behavior as variables). For more explanation on hoisting, refer to the question above on hoisting. If you try to invoke a function expression before it is defined, you will get an Uncaught TypeError: XXX is not a function error.
          </p>

          <h4>Function Declaration</h4>
          <pre class="codeedit" style="padding-bottom: 0px" ><code class="language-js">
foo(); // 'FOOOOO'
function foo() {

        <button class="accordion">What are the differences between variables created using let, var or const?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            Variables declared using the var keyword are scoped to the function in which they are created, or if created outside of any function, to the global object. let and const are block scoped, meaning they are only accessible within the nearest set of curly braces (function, if-else block, or for-loop).
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>var allows variables to be hoisted, meaning they can be referenced in code before they are declared. let and const will not allow this, instead throwing an error.</li>
            <li>Redeclaring a variable with var will not throw an error, but 'let' and 'const' will.</li>
            <li>let and const differ in that let allows reassigning the variable's value while const does not.</li>
          </ul>

        <button class="accordion">Can you offer a use case for the new arrow => function syntax? How does this new syntax differ from other functions?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            One obvious benefit of arrow functions is to simplify the syntax needed to create functions, without a need for the function keyword. The this within arrow functions is also bound to the enclosing scope which is different compared to regular functions where the this is determined by the object calling it. Lexically-scoped this is useful when invoking callbacks especially in React components.

        <button class="accordion">What is the definition of a higher-order function?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            A higher-order function is any function that takes one or more functions as arguments, which it uses to operate on some data, and/or returns a function as a result. Higher-order functions are meant to abstract some operation that is performed repeatedly. The classic example of this is map, which takes an array and a function as arguments. map then uses this function to transform each item in the array, returning a new array with the transformed data. Other popular examples in JavaScript are forEach, filter, and reduce. A higher-order function doesn't just need to be manipulating arrays as there are many use cases for returning a function from another function. Function.prototype.bind is one such example in JavaScript.

            However, in modern SPAs, client-side rendering is used instead. The browser loads the initial page from the server, along with the scripts (frameworks, libraries, app code) and stylesheets required for the whole app. When the user navigates to other pages, a page refresh is not triggered. The URL of the page is updated via the HTML5 History API. New data required for the new page, usually in JSON format, is retrieved by the browser via AJAX requests to the server. The SPA then dynamically updates the page with the data via JavaScript, which it has already downloaded in the initial page load. This model is similar to how native mobile apps work.
          </p>

          <h4>The benefits:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>The app feels more responsive and users do not see the flash between page navigations due to full-page refreshes.</li>
            <li>Fewer HTTP requests are made to the server, as the same assets do not have to be downloaded again for each page load.</li>
            <li>Clear separation of the concerns between the client and the server; you can easily build new clients for different platforms (e.g. mobile, chatbots, smart watches) without having to modify the server code. You can also modify the technology stack on the client and server independently, as long as the API contract is not broken.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>The downsides:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Heavier initial page load due to the loading of framework, app code, and assets required for multiple pages.</li>
            <li>There's an additional step to be done on your server which is to configure it to route all requests to a single entry point and allow client-side routing to take over from there.</li>
            <li>SPAs are reliant on JavaScript to render content, but not all search engines execute JavaScript during crawling, and they may see empty content on your page. This inadvertently hurts the Search Engine Optimization (SEO) of your app.</li>

        <button class="accordion">What is the extent of your experience with Promises and/or their polyfills?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            Possess working knowledge of it. A promise is an object that may produce a single value sometime in the future: either a resolved value or a reason that it's not resolved (e.g., a network error occurred). A promise may be in one of 3 possible states: fulfilled, rejected, or pending. Promise users can attach callbacks to handle the fulfilled value or the reason for rejection.<br>

            Some common polyfills are $.deferred, Q and Bluebird but not all of them comply with the specification. ES2015 supports Promises out of the box and polyfills are typically not needed these days.
          </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">What are the pros and cons of using Promises instead of callbacks?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <h4>Pros</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>void callback hell which can be unreadable.</li>
            <li>Makes it easy to write sequential asynchronous code that is readable with .then().</li>
            <li>Makes it easy to write parallel asynchronous code with Promise.all().</li>
            <li>With promises, these scenarios which are present in callbacks-only coding, will not happen:<br>
                a. Call the callback too early<br>
                b. Call the callback too late (or never)<br>
                c. Call the callback too few or too many times<br>
                d. Fail to pass along any necessary environment/parameters<br>
                e. Swallow any errors/exceptions that may happen<br>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Cons</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>lightly more complex code (debatable).</li>
            <li>In older browsers where ES2015 is not supported, you need to load a polyfill in order to use it.</li>

            For simple constructors, they look pretty similar.<br>
